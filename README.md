## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

You need Python 3.X and an environment (I used venv) containing the following pip packages:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project is part of the Data Scientist Udacity Nanodegree.  
I decided to find out more about sleep and sleep efficiency:

1. Does age influence the sleep duration?
2. Does caffeine consumption decrease sleep efficiency?
3. What other factors are most important for sleep efficiency?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is only one notebook containing all the relevant code.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post
available [here](http://schumacher.pythonanywhere.com/udacity/blog).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

The data is a Kaggle dataset, which can be
found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equilibriumm/sleep-efficiency/) (including Licence information).
You can use my code however you like.
